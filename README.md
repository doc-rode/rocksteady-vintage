# RockSteady — Vintage National-Park (multipage build)

A full **multipage** static build of the RockSteady site in the **Vintage National-Park**
design direction (Direction B from the design review). It preserves the navigation and
page organization of the current production site at
[rocksteady-fitness.com](https://rocksteady-fitness.com), and every subpage's copy is
reproduced **verbatim** from the current production pages.

```

## Navigation & organization (matches production)

- **Header:** Home · About · Guide · Privacy · Contact  +  "Get the app"
- **Footer — Pages:** Home · About · App Guide
- **Footer — Legal:** Privacy Policy · Terms of Service · Contact

Terms of Service lives in the footer only (no top-nav link), same as production.

## Design system

- **Fonts:** **Bricolage Grotesque** (display/body) + **Space Mono** (labels), **self-hosted**
  from `assets/fonts/` (SIL OFL 1.1 — see `assets/fonts/LICENSES.md`). No Google Fonts CDN, so
  no visitor IP is sent to Google.
- **Palette:** cream paper `#EFE6D2`, ink `#3A2E1F`, moss `#3A5A3C`, ochre/gold `#CB8B2E`,
  rust `#A8431E`, brown `#4A3826`. Hairline dashed rules and hard offset shadows.
- Fully static and self-contained — no external CDN calls (only the App Store deep-links).

## Copy provenance

Home copy is the approved vintage-park redesign copy. All six subpages
(`about`, `guide`, `user-guide`, `contact`, `privacy`, `terms`) carry the **exact** text of
the corresponding production pages — verified string-for-string against
`rocksteady-fitness-website/pages/*.html`. No wording was changed, added, or removed.

## Known follow-ups (not copy changes)

- **`user-guide.html`** is a **generated** page in production (built from `docs/User-Guide.md`
  via `scripts/build-guide.py`). It has been ported here as a static vintage page with the
  body copy verbatim. If the Markdown source changes, this page must be regenerated/re-skinned
  to match (the build script's template still emits the old slate-blue design).
- **App Store badge** — CTAs now use the official **"Download on the App Store"** badge
  layout (`assets/img/appstore-badge-black.svg` on light sections, `-white.svg` on the dark
  rust CTA bands) instead of a custom Apple-logo button, per Apple's marketing guidelines.
  These SVGs are faithful reproductions of Apple's badge; for full compliance, replace the two
  files in-place with Apple's official downloaded artwork (same filenames — drop-in swap). The
  header "Get the app" link is plain text (no Apple logo), which is allowed. **This is also a
  fix worth applying to the production site**, which still uses the custom Apple-logo button.
- **Home photography** — two full-bleed human photos (`assets/img/photo-climbing.jpg`,
  `photo-lakefront-rest.jpg`) put a human face on the app. They are **AI-generated placeholders**
  (so there's no third-party stock license to clear) — optimized to ~200–260 KB JPEGs. Before
  launch: (1) eyeball them at full size for AI artifacts (hands/feet/watches), and (2) plan to
  **swap in authentic photos of real users/locations** when available — the strongest
  "a human made this" signal.
- **Contact form** has no backend (mirrors production): it validates and shows the
  "Message sent" confirmation client-side only. Wire to a real handler before launch.
- Guide/how-to screenshots that didn't exist in the vintage asset bundle are shown as
  vintage placeholder panels (play badge + duration); no images were invented.
